2. \textbf{Diode Circuits: }The diode behaves like a switch; it is on when forward-biased (Vin > 0.7V), and off otherwise.

The Yellow line represents the Vin, the Blue line represents the Vout.

    \label{fig:graph3}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Description:} A forward-biased diode in series with a resistor.

\textbf{Expected Behavior:} The diode will conduct (be "on") when the input voltage 
Vin is greater than the forward voltage of the diode 
(about 0.7V for a silicon diode). When the input drops below 0.7V, the diode 
will be off, and Vout will be near zero.

\textbf{Oscilloscope Data:} In the graph, you can see that the yellow waveform 
(Vin) is sinusoidal, and the blue waveform (Vout) shows clipping at 
approximately 0.7V, confirming that the diode only conducts when Vin>0.7V.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab4_2_2.png}
    \caption{Circuit 2 Results}
    \label{fig:graph4}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Description:} A reverse-biased diode in series with a resistor.

\textbf{Expected Behavior:} In this case, the diode will not conduct under normal forward voltage conditions, as it is reverse-biased. Hence, 
Vout will be almost zero throughout the entire cycle of = Vin.

\textbf{Oscilloscope Data:} The second graph shows that the blue waveform (Vout) is almost flat, indicating the diode is not conducting, as expected for a reverse-biased diode.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab4_2_3.png}
    \caption{Circuit 3 Results}
    \label{fig:graph5}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Description:} A forward-biased diode, with the diode grounded.

\textbf{Expected Behavior:} Similar to Circuit 1, but this time, the diode is connected to the ground. The output 
Vout will be clamped at 0.7V during the positive cycle of 
Vin, and the diode will conduct when > 0.7V. Vin>0.7V. 

\textbf{Oscilloscope Data:} In the third graph, the blue waveform again shows clipping at around 0.7V, indicating that the diode is conducting when 
Vin>0.7V, and is off otherwise.

    \caption{Circuit 4 Results}
    \label{fig:graph6}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Description:} A reverse-biased diode, similar to Circuit 2 but with reversed polarity.

\textbf{Expected Behavior:} The diode will not conduct during the positive cycles of 
Vin, but it may conduct slightly during negative cycles if the reverse breakdown voltage is reached. However, for most practical situations, the output will be near zero.

\textbf{Oscilloscope Data:} The fourth graph shows minimal activity on the blue waveform (Vout), confirming that the diode remains off, as expected for a reverse-biased diode.s

3.\textbf{Voltage Clamp Circuit:} Adjusting the +1V shifted the output. The diode was **on** when Vin exceeded the forward voltage and bias.

    \caption{Circuit Results}
    \label{fig:graph11}
\end{figure}

Explanation of Diode Behavior:
D1 (Forward Biased): When the input signal is positive, D1 conducts and the output voltage is clamped near 0.7V.
D2 (Forward Biased): When the input signal is negative, D2 conducts and the output is clamped near -0.7V.

Regions of On and Off States:
D1 is on during the positive half-cycle of the input waveform when Vin $\ge$ 0.7V.
D2 is on during the negative half-cycle of the input waveform when Vin$\le$-0.7V.
During these times, the output is clamped to the diode's forward voltage, limiting the maximum and minimum values of 
Vout.

5.\textbf{Ripple and DC} The plot of \( VDC/Vripple \) versus R indicated a smoother rectification with higher resistance.

\end{figure}

\section*{Question 5}

We used a capacitor with a capacitance of \(C = 0.94 \, \mu F\) and resistances of \( R_1 = 106.4 \, k\Omega \) and \( R_2 = 48.7 \, k\Omega \). The circuit was set at a frequency of 1.5 kHz.

The ripple voltage \( V_{ripple} \) is defined as:

\[
V_{ripple} = V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}
\]

The DC voltage \( V_{DC} \) is given by:

\[
V_{DC} = \frac{V_{\text{max}} + V_{\text{min}}}{2}
\]

We recorded the following values for different resistances:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Filtering Resistance (R) & \( V_{ripple} \) (V) & \( V_{DC} \) (V) \\
\hline
100 k\(\Omega\) & 0.6 & 4.44 \\
50 k\(\Omega\) & 0.4 & 4.76 \\
10 k\(\Omega\) & 0.2 & 4.86 \\
5 k\(\Omega\)  & 0.8 & 4.2  \\
200 \(\Omega\) & 3.4 & 1.51 \\
500 \(\Omega\) & 3.0 & 2.32 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{figure}


6.\textbf{I-V Curve of Zener Diode}: The Zener diode conducted in reverse once the 5V breakdown voltage was reached.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/other/Lab4_6.png}
    \caption{Graph of \( VDC/Vripple \) versus R}
    \label{fig:graph14}
\end{figure}

We used a Zener diode with a forward voltage of 0.702V. The resistor was set at \( R = 47.6 \, k\Omega \). The goal was to limit the current to 50 mA.

From Ohm's law:

\[
R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{5 \, \text{V}}{0.05 \, \text{A}} = 100 \, \Omega
\]

### Measured I-V Data:
The following table presents the measured current for different voltage values across the Zener diode.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline

\subsection*{Important Concepts}
- \textbf{Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)}: A type of transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers.
- \textbf{NPN and PNP Transistors}: These are two types of BJTs. In NPN, current flows from the collector to the emitter when the base is forward biased. In PNP, the current flows in the opposite direction.
- \textbf{Current Gain (\(\beta\))}: Defined as the ratio of the collector current (\(I_C\)) to the base current (\(I_B\)).
  \[
  \beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B}
  \]
- \textbf{Saturation Voltage (\(V_{CE(sat)}\))}: The minimum collector-emitter voltage where the transistor is still in the active mode.

  where \(I_E\) is the emitter current.
  
\subsection*{FYR Questions}

1. \textbf{Transistor Diode Drops}:
We measured the diode drops for different transistors using the diode setting on a multimeter. Below are the measured forward voltage drops for each transistor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{3904 (PNP)}: 0.697 V drop
    \item \textbf{3906 (NPN)}: 0.700 V drop
    \item \textbf{2N2222 (PNP)}: 0.652 V drop
\end{itemize}

### Explanation:
The measured voltage drops correspond to the forward voltage required to turn on the diode within the transistor, which is typically between 0.6V and 0.7V for silicon-based devices. Here's an explanation for each:
\\ \\

- \textbf{PNP Transistors (3904 and 2N2222)}: The forward voltage drop for these PNP transistors is approximately 0.697V and 0.652V respectively. This value is close to the typical forward voltage for silicon-based diodes (~0.7V). The slightly lower value for the 2N2222 may be due to manufacturing variations or slight differences in the materials used.
  
- \textbf{NPN Transistor (3906)}: The NPN transistor shows a forward voltage drop of 0.700V, which aligns well with the typical forward voltage for silicon diodes. This is the voltage required to forward bias the base-emitter junction of the transistor.
\\ \\

These small differences in voltage drop can be attributed to the variations in the semiconductor materials or the specific doping levels used in each transistor. However, all values fall within the expected range for silicon-based BJTs.
 \\ \\ 

 
2. \textbf{Transistor Circuit Measurements}:

In this question, we analyzed two cases with different base currents. Below are the measured results for both Case A and Case B.
\\ \\ 
### Case A: \\ 
For Case A, we set the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R_B = 200 \, k\Omega \)
    \item \( R_C = 2 \, k\Omega \)
    \item \( V_{CC} = 10 \, V \)
    \item \( I_B = 20 \, \mu A \)
\end{itemize}
\\
The base current \( I_B \) was set to 20 \(\mu A\), and we varied \( V_{CC} \) to measure the corresponding collector current \( I_C \) and the collector-emitter voltage \( V_{CE} \). The results are shown in the table below:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
V_{CC} \, (\text{V}) & I_C \, (\mu A) & V_{CE} \, (\text{mV}) \\
\hline
10.0 & 1.0 & -915 \\
9.0  & 0.9 & -805 \\
8.0  & 0.8 & -720 \\
6.8  & 0.7 & -625 \\
6.0  & 0.7 & -563 \\
5.0  & 0.6 & -494 \\
4.0  & 0.5 & -384 \\
3.5  & 0.5 & -36 \\
1.5  & 0.3 & -28 \\
1.0  & 0.2 & -25 \\
0.0  & 0.1 & -22.8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\\ \\ 
### Case B: \\ 
For Case B, we set the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R_B = 100 \, \Omega \)
    \item \( R_C = 2 \, k\Omega \)
    \item \( V_{CC} = 10 \, V \)
    \item \( I_B = 40 \, \mu A \)
\end{itemize}

The base current \( I_B \) was set to 40 \(\mu A\), and we varied \( V_{CC} \) to measure the corresponding collector current \( I_C \) and the collector-emitter voltage \( V_{CE} \). The results are shown in the table below:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
V_{CC} \, (\text{V}) & I_C \, (\mu A) & V_{CE} \, (\text{mV}) \\
\hline
9.7  & 1.0 & -957 \\
8.5  & 0.9 & -834 \\
7.4  & 0.8 & -721 \\
6.0  & 0.6 & -586 \\
5.0  & 0.6 & -461 \\
4.0  & 0.5 & -39 \\
2.7  & 0.4 & -28 \\
2.0  & 0.3 & -24 \\
1.0  & 0.2 & -25 \\
0.0  & 0.1 & -28 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\\
### Analysis:
\\
- As \( V_{CC} \) decreases, the collector current \( I_C \) decreases in both cases, but \( I_C \) is larger in Case B due to the higher base current.
\\
- The collector-emitter voltage \( V_{CE} \) also decreases and becomes less negative, especially in Case A, as the transistor approaches saturation.
\\
- In Case B, saturation occurs at a higher \( I_C \) due to the larger base current, indicating the higher current gain (\( \beta \)) in Case B.
\\
- Biggest drop happend around 3.5V, where \( V_{CE} \) dropped from -384mV to -36mV. This is likely due to the transistor entering saturation mode, where the collector current is nearly constant and the voltage drop across the collector-emitter junction is minimized.
\\ \\ 
### Graph:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_2Plot.png}
    \caption{\(I_{C} \) vs \( V_{CE} \) Plot, with fit function for measured data}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}
\\ \\ 


3. \textbf{Saturation Voltage and Current Gain}:
\\
### Case A: \\
- Base current \( I_B = 20 \, \mu A \) \\ 
- The estimated saturation voltage for Case A is: \\
  \[
  V_{CE(sat)} \approx -25 \, \text{mV}
  \]
\\
- The current gain \( \beta \) for Case A was calculated using \( \beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B} \). The values of \( \beta \) increase with \( V_{CE} \), reaching higher values before flattening out as the transistor approaches saturation.
\\ \\ 
### Case B: \\ 
- Base current \( I_B = 40 \, \mu A \) \\ 
- The estimated saturation voltage for Case B is: \\
  \[
  V_{CE(sat)} \approx -28 \, \text{mV}
  \]
\\
- The current gain \( \beta \) for Case B is higher than Case A, indicating greater amplification due to the increased base current.
\\ \\
### Conclusion:
From the plots, we can see that both transistors enter saturation at approximately similar values of \( V_{CE(sat)} \), with Case B 
showing a slightly higher \( \beta \) due to the higher base current. These results align with the expected behavior of the 
transistor in active and saturation regions.

### Graph:

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_3.png}
    \caption{Graph of \(\beta\) vs \(V_{CE}\) for Case A and Case B. with \(v_{CE -sat point}\) marked. The Saturation point value was determined by looking where the graphs from question 2 dipped in change.}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}

4. \textbf{Collector Current vs Base-Emitter Voltage}:
\\
The relationship between the collector current \( I_C \) and the base-emitter voltage \( V_{BE} \) is given by the Ebers-Moll equation:
\\
\[
I_C = I_S \left( e^{\frac{V_{BE}}{kT}} - 1 \right)
\]
\\ \\ 
### Graphs:
\\ \\
1. \textbf{Linear Scale}: The plot of \( I_C \) vs. \( V_{BE} \) on a linear scale shows a near-exponential increase in collector current as the base-emitter voltage increases. This is consistent with the expected behavior of a transistor in forward active mode.
\\ \\ 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_4_linear.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}

2. \textbf{Logarithmic Scale}: The plot of \( I_C \) vs. \( V_{BE} \) on a logarithmic scale highlights the exponential nature of the relationship. The straight-line behavior on the logarithmic plot confirms the exponential relationship predicted by the Ebers-Moll equation.
\\ \\ 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_4_Log.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}


### Conclusion:
The data confirms the exponential relationship between \( I_C \) and \( V_{BE} \), as expected from the theory. As the base-emitter voltage increases, the collector current rises exponentially, which is a key characteristic of the transistor's operation in active mode.
\\ \\ 

5. \textbf{Sine Wave Amplification}:
\\ \\ 
In this experiment, we are asked to predict the behavior of \( V_{out} \) and \( V_B \) for different input amplitudes. Below is an analysis based on the circuit configuration and values provided.

\\
### Circuit Parameters:
\\ \\ 
- \( R_B = 10 \, k\Omega \) \\ 
- \( V_{in} = 0.5 \, V \, \text{pp} \), 1 kHz sine wave with no DC offset. \\ 
- \( V_{CC} \) is set between +10V and +15V, We set it to 15v \\ 
\\ \\ 
### Initial Input Amplitude (Less than 0.7V): \\ \\ 
For small input signals (less than 0.7V), the base-emitter junction is not fully forward biased. In this region:
\\ \\ 
- The base voltage \( V_B \) follows the input signal with a small amplitude. \\ 
- The output voltage \( V_{out} \) remains relatively high, near \( V_{CC} \), as the transistor is not conducting significantly.\\ 
\\ \\

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_5_Below.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}
\\ \\ 

### Input Amplitude Greater than 0.7V: \\ \\ 
As the input amplitude exceeds 0.7V, the base-emitter junction becomes fully forward biased. In this region: \\ \\
- \( V_B \) becomes clamped at approximately 0.7V, as the transistor turns on. \\ 
- The collector current \( I_C \) increases, causing a larger voltage drop across \( R_C \), which decreases \( V_{out} \). \\
\\ \\ 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_5_Above.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}
\\ \\ 

### Explanation: \\ \\
- The diode between the base and emitter becomes forward biased when \( V_{in} \) exceeds 0.7V, clamping \( V_B \) at this value. \\ 
- The voltage drop across \( R_C \) increases as \( I_C \) increases, reducing \( V_{out} \). \\ 
- The relationship between \( I_C \) and \( I_B \) is governed by the current gain \( \beta \), with \( I_C = \beta I_B \). \\ 

\\ \\ 
6. \textbf{Undistorted Sine Wave}:
\\ \\ 

In this part of the experiment, we predicted the behavior of a common-emitter amplifier with the following parameters: \\ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input signal: \( V_{in} = 1 \, \text{V peak-to-peak} \), sine wave
    \item Supply voltage: \( V_{CC} = 15 \, \text{V DC} \)
    \item Resistors: \( R_B = 10 \, k\Omega \), \( R_C = 2 \, k\Omega \), \( R_E = 1 \, k\Omega \)
\end{itemize}
\\ \\ 
### Gain Calculation: \\ 
The gain for a common-emitter amplifier is given by the formula:\\ 
\[
A_v = - \frac{R_C}{R_E}
\]
Substituting the given values:\\ 
\[
A_v = - \frac{2 \, k\Omega}{1 \, k\Omega} = -2
\]
\\
The output voltage is therefore inverted and amplified by a factor of 2 compared to the input voltage.
\\ \\ 
### Graph\\
The following graph illustrates the input and output waveforms: \\ 
- The input waveform is a 1V peak-to-peak sine wave. \\ 
- The output waveform is inverted and amplified by a factor of -2. \\ 
\\ 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_6.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}
\\ \\

The calculated gain is \( A_v \approx -2 \), consistent with the theoretical prediction.


7. \textbf{Output Distortion and Clipping} \\ \\

In this experiment, we increased the input signal beyond the normal operating limits of the transistor amplifier. The circuit parameters are:\\ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input signal: \( V_{in} = 2 \, \text{V peak-to-peak} \), sine wave
    \item Supply voltage: \( V_{CC} = 15 \, \text{V DC} \)
    \item Gain: \( A_v = -2 \)
\end{itemize}
\\ \\ 
### Clipping and Distortion: \\
As the input signal increased beyond the operating limits of the amplifier, the output signal began to clip. Clipping occurs when the output signal exceeds the supply voltage (\( \pm 15 \, \text{V} \)) and the transistor enters its saturation or cut-off region. In this region:
\\
- The gain no longer follows a linear relationship, and the output signal flattens at the peaks.\\ 
\\  \\ß
\textbf{Graph:} \\ \\
The following graph shows the input and output signals. The output is clearly clipped at \( \pm 15 \, \text{V} \), indicating the limits of the transistor’s amplification.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab5_7.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}


### Conclusion: \\ 
Clipping is a common effect in amplifiers when the input signal is too large. The transistor can no longer linearly amplify the input, resulting in distortion at the peaks of the output signal.

\subsection*{Important Concepts}
- \textbf{Field Effect Transistors (FETs)}: FETs are a type of transistor where the current is controlled by an electric field. The two types of FETs used in this lab are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{J310 JFET (n-channel)}: A depletion-mode FET, where current flows with zero gate-source voltage, and applying negative \( V_{GS} \) reduces current.
    \item \textbf{2N7000 MOSFET (n-channel)}: An enhancement-mode FET, where no current flows with zero gate-source voltage, and positive \( V_{GS} \) is required to turn it on.

1. \textbf{J310 JFET Measurement and Transconductance:}
In this part of the experiment, we measured the drain current \( I_D \) as a function of the gate-source voltage \( V_{GS} \) for a J310 JFET. We also calculated the transistor's transconductance \( g_m \), which is the ratio of output current to input voltage.

### Data:
The following table shows the measured values for \( V_{GS} \) and \( I_D \):

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
V_{GS} \, (\text{V}) & I_D \, (\text{mA}) \\
\hline
5.0 & 38.0 \\
4.8 & 37.9 \\
4.6 & 37.2 \\
4.4 & 37.5 \\
4.2 & 37.3 \\
4.0 & 37.0 \\
3.8 & 36.9 \\
3.6 & 36.7 \\
3.4 & 36.5 \\
3.2 & 36.3 \\
3.0 & 36.1 \\
2.8 & 36.0 \\
2.6 & 35.7 \\
2.4 & 35.5 \\
2.2 & 35.3 \\
2.0 & 35.0 \\
1.8 & 34.7 \\
1.6 & 34.5 \\
1.4 & 34.2 \\
1.2 & 33.8 \\

### Plot of \( I_D \) vs \( V_{GS} \):
Below is the graph showing \( I_D \) as a function of \( V_{GS} \). As \( V_{GS} \) decreases, the drain current \( I_D \) also decreases, demonstrating the depletion-mode behavior typical of a JFET.

\end{figure}

### Transconductance Calculation:
The transconductance \( g_m \) is defined as:
\[
g_m = \frac{I_D}{V_{GS}}
\]
The following plot shows the calculated transconductance \( g_m \) as a function of \( V_{GS} \). The transconductance decreases as \( V_{GS} \) becomes more negative, which aligns with the expected behavior of the J310 JFET.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/Lab6_1_gmVSVgs.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:graph1} 
\end{figure}
\\ 
### Comparison with J310 Data Sheet:
The results align with the J310 JFET data sheet, which shows similar behavior for \( I_D \) vs \( V_{GS} \) and for transconductance. The decreasing transconductance with more negative \( V_{GS} \) is characteristic of depletion-mode JFETs. The calculated \( g_m \) values are consistent with typical transconductance values for JFETs, where the device exhibits high gain in the saturation region and lower gain as it approaches the cutoff region.
\\ \\  
### Conclusion:
The measured values for \( I_D \) and \( g_m \) are consistent with the expected behavior of a J310 JFET, as confirmed by comparison with the device's data sheet. The drain current decreases with decreasing \( V_{GS} \), and the transconductance decreases as the device approaches cutoff.
